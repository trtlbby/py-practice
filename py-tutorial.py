#A tutorial to familiarize with Python!!!

#Getting started with variables.
#I can start by doing this: Let's use x and y for main variable name globally

#Start:
x = 0
y = 1
print(x, y)
#Output: 0 1
#Compare to Java that im familiar with Python doesn't use + sign when printing two value

#Hello world
print("Hello, World!") #merge this to v0.2
