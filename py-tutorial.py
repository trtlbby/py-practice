#A tutorial to familiarize with Python!!!

#Getting started with variables.
#I can start by doing this: Let's use x and y for main variable name globally

#Array
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "mango", "banana", "strawberry"]
print(fruits) #Print whole array

print(fruits[0])#Print single index from an array

print(fruits[2:4])#Print from index x to index y

#Hello world
print("Hello, World!") #merge this to v0.2
